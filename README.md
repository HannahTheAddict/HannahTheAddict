👋 Hi, I’m @HannahTheAddict – the high school coding whiz with a love for all things tech!
| I’m interested in turning caffeine into code, winning every programming contest I enter, and debating whether "S" in CSS stands for "Sassy" or "Stylish."
| I’m currently learning to juggle multiple coding languages without losing my sanity and perfecting my pizza-eating skills (because every coder needs fuel).
| I’m looking to collaborate on projects that make people go “Wow!” or at least “Hmm, that’s cool!” – and maybe a little bit of world-saving on the side.
| How to reach me: Slide into my DMs or send a carrier pigeon (just kidding – a message here works too!).
| Pronouns: She/Her – but feel free to call me "Code Queen" if you’re feeling fancy.
| Fun fact: I once coded a project so well that even my bugs were impressed!
